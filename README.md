## Prompts
 

* Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was centered around designing an online system for a client seeking to streamline the process of driver education and training. The client wanted a comprehensive system that would allow users to manage lesson bookings, track progess and access various resources related to their training. The system also had to support administration.

* What did you do particularly well? If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One aspect I excelled in was creating clear and well-structured diagrams that accurately represented the system's requirements and interactions. The diagrams effectively captured the use cases and proccesses and provided a strong visual front for the system's overall design. One area that could use some improvement it would be the overall layout of the documents, I would revise them and make the document itself a little more user friendly. 

* How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It was my interpretation that the user's needs were critical to the design of the system. Considering the user's needs is very important because it ensures that the final product is both functional and user friendly.


* How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

This is a hard question because it's not so univariate but I would say that I would attempt to take a user centered approach and figure out exactly what the client/user wants and needs and do my best to implement said features.
